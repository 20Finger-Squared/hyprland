# Where to start
Well this config was made to be as easy to configure as I thought I could make it.
So you'll notice that all the things you need to change are in the ./vars/ directory.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `gf` in normal mode in vim to visit a file.

If you want to change your bindings go to ./vars/hyprbinds.conf
If you want to change the more in depth bindings go to the ./vars/advanced-binds.conf

> [!WARNING]
> In the ./configs/binding.conf at the bottom of the file are the multimedia keys
> Make sure that the one for you is uncommented and delete or comment the other paragraph
